About This Program:
*********************

This is a command-line implementation of chess that uses standard algebraic notation in order to make moves. It is currently a two-human player game. I would like to start implementing a computer opponent after all game mechanics and user interface design has been completed.

The game currently has core mechanics in place, and pieces can be moved and captured, all while adhering to individual piece moving rules.


*********************
To Implement:
*********************
- To ensure capturing and moving of all algebraic notation calls are utilized.
- game concept of checkmate
- vectors to hold captured pieces
- display captured pieces
- Undo
- Ability to load/save .pgn files
